# Adventures of Piggy
A 2D platforming game I created in high school using Stencyl! Play it in the following ways:
* On [Newgrounds](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/708019) (requires [Newgrounds Flash Player](https://www.newgrounds.com/flash/player)).
* Download `FinalAdventuresofPiggy.swf`, an Adobe Flash file of the game. Use an [Adobe Flash Player Emulator](https://ruffle.rs/) to play it locally.
